# eCommerce Transactions Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA), lookalike model, and customer segmentation tasks for an eCommerce transactions dataset. The dataset includes three primary files: **Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv**, and the analysis has been performed on each dataset individually as well as in combination.

## Repository Structure
### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA has been performed on each dataset separately and in combination. The following Jupyter Notebooks contain detailed analysis:

- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Customer_EDA.ipynb** â†’ EDA on Customers dataset
- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Product_EDA.ipynb** â†’ EDA on Products dataset
- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Transaction_EDA.ipynb** â†’ EDA on Transactions dataset
- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Transaction_Customer_EDA.ipynb** â†’ Combined analysis of Transactions and Customers dataset
- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Transaction_Product_Customer_EDA.ipynb** â†’ Combined analysis of Transactions, Products, and Customers dataset

**EDA Reports:**
- **Kishan_Jaiswal_EDA.pdf** â†’ Summary of business insights derived from EDA

### 2. **Task 2: Lookalike Model**
A Lookalike Model was developed to find the top 3 similar customers based on transaction history and profile data. 

- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Lookalike.ipynb** â†’ Jupyter Notebook explaining the Lookalike Model implementation
- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Lookalike.csv** â†’ Output file mapping each customer to their top 3 similar customers along with similarity scores

### 3. **Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**
Customer segmentation was performed using clustering techniques. The number of clusters was optimized using evaluation metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Index.

- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Clustering.ipynb** â†’ Jupyter Notebook detailing the clustering approach
- **Kishan_Jaiswal_Clustering.pdf** â†’ Report summarizing the clustering results
